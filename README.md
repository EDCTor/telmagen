#TELMAGEN - Tor's Elapsed Map Generator

The application prompts for an image (that represents a map) and a time interval in minutes (i.e. every 15 minutes). Then for each interval over a 24 hour period, data points (that represent objects that are being tracked) can be plotted.

The overall series of time periods and data points can be played back in slideshow fashion to show how the objects move over time. 

I create/used this for a tabletop game named M.E.R.P. in order to show how the orcs in an army moved about their camp in a 24 hour period. In my case, I had a map that represented the topography of the area and the buildings in the camp. I then relabeled the different colors for the different types of creatures (blue was an orc scout, red was an orc general, yellow was a human slave, grey was a wolf, etc). The PC's in the group were allowed to watch the slideshow, the longer they watched the more information they got about the army's movements. However the longer they watched, they also had a greater chance of being discovered by any scouts in the area.
